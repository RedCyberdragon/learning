So, after searching for a tutorial for so long and finding ones that told
me to set up an SSH key and deleting that SSH key and copying the deleted
file to a random folder which didn't exist, I devided to make a list about
how I learned how to use Git with Github in hopes that it will be helpful
to someone someday.

My system:
Custom Built Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit

1.	Creating an SSH keypair

1.1	Get to your hidden SSH folder.
	$cd ~/.ssh

1.2	This version of Ubuntu seems to have a tool for generating SSH
	keys pre-installed, conveniently called ssh-keygen. Start it up.
	$ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"

1.3	Backing up the key is a good idea, I suppose, so I'm going to go
	ahead and do that here in a folder called key_backup
	$mkdir key_backup
	$cp id_rsa* key_backup

1.4	So, once you have a key, you can set it up
